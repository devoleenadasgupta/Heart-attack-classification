# Heart-attack-classification
This project explores heart attack prediction using machine learning, focusing on Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. The dataset is first loaded and examined to understand its structure. A thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted, checking for missing values, summarizing key statistics, and analyzing the available features to identify patterns that might influence heart disease prediction.
Once the data is preprocessed, it is split into training and testing sets to ensure fair evaluation of the models. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers are then trained on the data. Their performance is assessed based on how accurately they can predict heart attacks in unseen cases.
To measure how well these models perform, accuracy scores are calculated. The Logistic Regression model's accuracy is determined using standard evaluation metrics, while the Decision Tree classifier's performance is evaluated using its built-in scoring method. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visually analyze the correctness of predictions and spot any potential misclassifications.
By comparing both models, this study highlights how machine learning can be applied to medical diagnosis. The findings provide valuable insights into which model is more effective for heart attack prediction, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven healthcare solutions to support doctors in making informed decisions.
